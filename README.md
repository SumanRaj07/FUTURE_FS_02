Mini Full-Stack E-Commerce Store
This project is a Mini Full-Stack E-Commerce Store developed to demonstrate my skills in modern front-end design and basic back-end integration. The application features a clean, Apple-inspired dark user interface and provides a smooth shopping experience from product browsing to order placement.

The frontend is built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript, offering a responsive and interactive layout. Users can browse products, search by name, filter by category, add items to a cart, adjust quantities, and view real-time price updates. A login modal is included to simulate user authentication and enhance user experience.

The cart system dynamically updates the item count and subtotal using JavaScript and DOM manipulation. A dedicated checkout modal allows users to enter delivery details and optionally upload an image related to the order. Form validation ensures that required information is provided before order submission.

The backend is implemented using Python with Flask, which receives checkout data from the frontend, generates a unique order ID, and stores order details in an orders.json file for record keeping. This demonstrates basic server-side processing and data persistence without using a full database.

After a successful order placement, the application displays a confirmation toast notification and automatically opens WhatsApp with pre-filled order details, simulating real-world order communication with a store owner. The project effectively showcases frontend-backend communication, UI/UX design principles, and basic full-stack web development concepts.
